So, goal is to move input/output functions to a separate JS file, so all the different testing modes can be clearly separated out.

Modes: 
A) Against arbitrary HLS stream
B) Directly against the Restreamer (arbitrary time codes)
C) Against Thrimshim (eventual production, passing IDs)

What to handle in different modes:
1) On Page Load
    A) Load default video and autoplay
    B) Only load video if sessionstorage/querystring is populated.
    C) Only load video if querystring is populated with UUID.
2) On Load Playlist
    A) Panel should display an input box for a URL, and load that.
    B) Current functionality
    C) Panel should be hidden? Users should only get to this page via a link with querystring.
3) On Submit
    A) Do nothing.
    B) Direct call to cutter, populate iframe
        ->Remove Firebase stuff, thrimshim is replacing that.
    C) Post to thrimshim.
