<SafeBot> MasterGunner: as noted in the readme, they expect the base directory (containing CHANNEL/QUALITY/HOUR/FILE.ts segments) mounted at /mnt, which you'd generally run like this: docker run -v /path/to/that/directory:/mnt IMAGE < From ekimekim on Mon, 31 Dec 2018 05:37:51 UTC (11 hours 56 minutes ago)
<SafeBot> MasterGunner: you'd then need to find the ip of that docker image (google it), then you can hit the http api at <that ip>:8000 < From ekimekim on Mon, 31 Dec 2018 05:38:49 UTC (11 hours 55 minutes ago)
<SafeBot> MasterGunner: for the downloader, it also expects the channel name as an arg, so you'd run it like this: docker run -v /path/to/base/dir:/mnt IMAGE CHANNEL < From ekimekim on Mon, 31 Dec 2018 05:40:09 UTC (11 hours 54 minutes ago)

Authentication
    Only really matters on POST
    Want roles for admin, editors, and viewers.

Editor - Thumbnails while seeking.
    Low priority.

Editor - Thrim-Shim
    Make current header only available on debug/advanced mode.
    New header just displays bus-time and "Load" button.
    Querystring holds ID, used to call Thrim-Shim/Database.
        Config file sets Thrim-Shim URL?
    
Admin Dashboard
    New page that dumps the "Events" table of the database (via Thrim-Shim).
    Sheet input fields are read-only. Thrimbletrimmer & Wubloader columns (such as Status field) can be manually set.

Viewer Page
    Just plays back the video for the selected time range (or live).
