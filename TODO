New Wubloader Integration
Write better build script with GULP (including minifying and packaging the Public folder)
Authentication & Session Management
"Night Mode" and cookie to support it.

"Queue" page to show videos currently awaiting edits (and who claimed them)
Separate queue for RDPs.
After video submission, redirect to queue page.

J/K/L as keyboard shortcuts to move forward/back by 5 seconds, and pause.

Resizable playback window/other solutions for extremely long videos.

Make "title too long warning" have a non-white background (eeeeh - but will work on visibility)


Video Player itself:
hls.js or video.js libraries to display Ekim's video stream.

Use the Azure Media Player instead of my hacked-together one?

    Plugins include things like thumbnails while seeking: https://amp.azure.net/libs/amp/latest/docs/PLUGINS.html
    So if this will work with Ekim's HLS stream, I'd want to create a plugin for my trim bar.
    Note their are different skins available, which change the controls layout - the "Sprite Tip" plugin demo looks to have the look I want.
    Oooh, Timeline Markers plugin could be handy for the trim bar.
    Or, use them to mark elements from the spreadsheet.

    ->Looks like this may only work with an Azure backend, at least without some hacking... and is probably built around video.js anyways.
        Well, it can do local .mp4 files.
